# Introduction

In this hands-on workshop, we will explore how to use Microsoft's Copilot Stack to develop your own AI-infused, enterprise-grade applications that improve productivity and create hyper-personalized product experiences.

We will also highlight the emergent capabilities that are advantageous to adopt, as well as the limitations that can be mitigated through engineering, particularly in the areas of orchestration and retrieval. Additionally, we will showcase the capabilities within the Copilot Stack that enable you to achieve this.
