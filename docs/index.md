Inspired by Github Copilot's impact on developer productivity, this experiential workshop is designed to demonstrate how you can infuse similar intelligence and product experience into traditional software systems. Using [Microsoft's Copilot stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/#semantic-kernel-is-at-the-center-of-the-copilot-stack) and practical [use cases](https://iappwksp.com/wksp/05-use-cases/#use-cases), this workshop will guide you in envisioning and creating intelligent systems and agents that integrate foundation models throughout all stages of application development - from design and user experience to deployment, resulting in improved productivity and hyper-personalized product experiences.

By leveraging design thinking, [Project Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi), and art-of-the-possible examples (with samples and skills from [Semantic Kernel (SK)](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi), and [Reddog](https://github.com/Azure/reddog-solutions)), this workshop offers a comprehensive, hands-on exploration of how foundation models can augment your applications with intelligence to create hyper-personalized product experiences and improve productivity. We will also have an Architecture Design Session (ADS) to unlock and operationalize the full potential of AI-infused applications for your organization.
