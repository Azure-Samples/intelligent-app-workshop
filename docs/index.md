We are undoubtedly experiencing one of the most significant technological transformations in the history of humanity. The adage is that AI won’t replace you but people using AI will. This also extends to software systems – Systems with AI will replace systems without. Our workshop is designed to help you envision and create these cutting-edge, intelligent systems that integrate AI throughout the entire lifecycle of your application, from user experience to design, development, and deployment.
By leveraging design thinking, [Semantic Kernel (SK)](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), and art-of-the-possible examples (with samples from SK and [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi)), this workshop offers a comprehensive, hands-on exploration of foundation models based on the transformers architecture, such as GPT. You will acquire skills to effectively curate and create value-driven workflows to serve your use cases with AI-first UX and architectures. We will also have an Architecture Design Session (ADS) to unlock and operationalize the full potential of AI-infused applications for your organization.

## Topics for the 2-day workshop

1. Introduction to Semantic Kernel (SK): A comprehensive presentation to familiarize participants with the fundamentals of SK and goals-first AI.
