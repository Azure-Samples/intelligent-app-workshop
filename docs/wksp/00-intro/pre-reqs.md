# Prerequisites

Before attending the Intelligent App Development Workshop, please ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Basic programming knowledge**: Familiarity with at least one programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, or C#) and basic understanding of software development concepts.

2. **Azure account**: A Microsoft Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

3. **Development environment**: A computer with your preferred development environment installed, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or another IDE that supports the programming language you'll be using in the workshop.

4. **Git**: Familiarity with Git and GitHub for version control. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your computer.

5. **Azure CLI**: Install the [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to interact with Azure services and manage resources from the command line.

6. **Azure Functions Core Tools**: Install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash#v2) to create, test, and deploy Azure Functions from your local development environment.

7. **Docker**: Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to build and run containerized applications.

8. **Hugging Face Transformers**: Familiarity with the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library for Natural Language Processing tasks using pre-trained models is recommended but not mandatory.

9. **Cognitive Services SDKs**: Install the SDKs for the Azure Cognitive Services you'll be using in the workshop, such as the [Azure OpenAI SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-openai/), based on your programming language and the services used during the workshop.

By ensuring you have completed these prerequisites, you'll be well-prepared to dive into the Intelligent App Development Workshop and make the most of the hands-on learning experience.
