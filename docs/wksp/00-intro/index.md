## Overview

We will take a methodical approach, starting slow and building concepts with a DIY (Do It Yourself) mindset. This workshop covers a wide range of topics, including the latest frameworks, approaches, and architectures in AI-driven app development, in addition to production-grade deployment options on Azure. We will begin by identifying customer needs and then work backwards to determine how these new technologies can address those needs by integrating AI into every step of the process.

### Who is this for

This workshop is designed for:

- Developers and Architects with a basic understanding of app development who want to incorporate AI into their apps
- Product managers and designers interested in leveraging AI to improve user experiences
