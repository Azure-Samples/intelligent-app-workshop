This is an envisioning workshop to rethink user experience, architecture, and app development by leveraging the intelligence of foundation models. This comprehensive workshop utilizes the [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) codebase and Semantic Kernel (SK), along with SK's Design thinking material, to guide you through the entire lifecycle of app development â€“ from identifying user needs to deploying a fully functional, production-grade app on Azure.

Key takeaways:

1. Uncover innovative ways to transform user experience and app design by integrating foundation models into interactions.
2. Learn how to effectively harness Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Miyagi codebase for streamlined development.
3. Rethink how to serve your end-user needs with Semantic Kernel's Design Thinking workshop.
4. Gain valuable insights into the production and deployment of apps powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
