This is an envisioning workshop, based on [Microsoft's Copilot stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/#semantic-kernel-is-at-the-center-of-the-copilot-stack), to rethink user experience, architecture, and app development by leveraging the intelligence of foundation models. This comprehensive workshop utilizes the [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) codebase and Semantic Kernel (SK), along with SK's Design thinking material, to guide you through the entire lifecycle of app development – from identifying user needs to deploying a fully functional, production-grade app on Azure.

Key takeaways:

1. Uncover innovative ways to transform user experience and app design by integrating foundation models into interactions.
2. Learn how to effectively harness Large Language Models (LLMs) with the [Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) codebase for streamlined development.
3. Rethink how to serve your end-user needs with Semantic Kernel's Design Thinking workshop.
4. Gain valuable insights into the production and deployment of apps powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
